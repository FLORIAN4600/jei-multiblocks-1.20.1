**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Specifically, include a description of observed effects in game, such as "JEI integration not working", "IE multiblocks not working at all", "Minecraft crashes when I open JEI", etc.

**Include a log**
The `latest.log` file inside the `logs` directory under your Minecraft installation can have valuable information on diagnosing issues. A full log file rather than a snippet is usually the most helpful.

**Other mods**
Does this issue happen with *only* this mod, Immersive Engineering, and JEI installed?

It's OK to report issues where other mods are installed, but please try to to narrow down the problematic integration first. Something like "Things work fine with the above 3 mods installed, but breaks as soon as I install CoolModTM" is helpful.
